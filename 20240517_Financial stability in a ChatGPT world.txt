 The financial system has seen some tough years, but it has coped with the challenges, perhaps even better than many of us expected. Fast forward to today, an inflation is coming down, but there could be bumps in the road ahead. Add to that growing duplicative risks and the unstoppable rise of artificial intelligence, and you'll see that the financial system still has a lot to contend with. So how capable is our financial system of withstanding shocks, which is basically the definition of financial stability? You're listening to the ECB podcast, bringing you insights into the world of economics and central banking. My name is Stefania Secula. I'm joined today by our regular guest John Fell who works on our Financial Stability Review which we published twice a year. We'll be talking about the latest issue that just came out. John, great to see you again. Hi Stefania, great to be back. John, the financial system was hit by several challenges in recent years. The pandemic and energy crisis just being two examples. And these challenges raise major concerns for financial stability. But when I read the latest issue of the Financial Stability Review, or as you call it in short, FSR, the term strikes me as somewhat more positive. So what's changed? Yes, your reading of the tone is indeed correct. We do have a more positive assessment this time. The last couple of years have been challenging with plenty of indications that the euro area financial cycle has gone through a marked contraction. But this has happened without triggering a financial crisis and that's really a positive. Yes. The reason for that is resilience, especially, you were talked about shocks, ability to absorb shocks, it's especially the resilience of households and firms balance sheets. Despite the big build-up of debt during the pandemic, firms and households are actually less indebted today on average than they were before COVID-19 arrived on the scene. Now that's partly thanks to the support that was provided by the public sector during those challenging times. And the composition of debt has also changed. Firms and households manage to lock in very low interest rates during the pandemic. And so that means that lending rates that are being paid on the outstanding loans or the loans that were taken out during COVID have risen more gradually than the headline rates that we see being quoted for new loans. And you remember last year we did endure some spillover from the stresses in US and the Swiss banking sectors. Yeah. But it was very short-lived and I think that was thanks to the strength of capital and liquidity buffers of euro area banks and the significant improvement of bank profitability. And because of all this and because non-financial sector balance sheets have for the most part been resilient to sharp interest rate hikes, the resilience of the banking sector was never really put to the test in this interest rate cycle. In turn that together with other factors such as corporate pricing power, lags and wage increases, that ensured resilience of corporate sector profitability, allowing firms then to hoard or keep labour when economic activity weakened. So in a sense there was a mutual reinforcement of resilience between households and firms and that meant that some of the concerns that we had for financial stability thankfully didn't materialize. I sense a but in your words John. Yes there was a but between the lines. Preparing this issue of the FASOR was a lot more challenging than usual and that's because some of the developments that have transpired since the November issue well they could be viewed positively I described some of them already from a financial stability perspective but others have been negative now while vulnerabilities might be easing much of our financial stability discussions these days are preoccupied with possible shocks and there's no and unfortunately there's no shortage of possibilities of things that could go wrong. So they include, we look at our core business, they include a macro outlook which remains uncertain and inflation which is lower, but not yet low enough, leaving room for disappointments. And then there is the big known, unknown geopolitical risks which have the potential to derail improving macro-financial conditions. So, bottom line, our assessment is that sources of risk and vulnerability for financial stability have eased, but the outlook is fragile. In a more precise technical language, we could say that the central scenario has improved, but downside tail risks have increased. Now while we still think that the deliberate efforts that have been taken to fortify capital and equity buffers within the banking system have positioned it well to face higher risks, there really is no room for complacency. Yes, and I see you have included in the FSR a special feature on geopolitics. So we're living in a world with more conflict and tension like Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine, conflict in Middle East, fears of escalation in the US, China tensions over Taiwan, and all these raise concerns for geopolitical stability. Now first and foremost conflicts have a human cost that is tragic and devastating. But John, your latest issue has also looked at what geopolitical risk can mean for financial stability. Tell us what you found and what you're going to keep a close eye on. So last time we spoke in general terms about the economic and financial channels through which geopolitical risk can affect financial stability. We had the conflict in the Middle East that just started at that time, but in the meantime we dug a bit deeper into the topic. The special feature on geopolitical risk is, I think, a rather comprehensive overview, reporting findings from several empirical analysis that my colleagues did. Now among the aspects examined, it looks at economic and financial market impacts as well as impacts on individual banks and on non-bank financial institutions. So confirming what we discussed last time we now have empirical evidence which actually shows that when geopolitical risk rises it raises inflation and it also slows economic activity in the euro area. But I think for financial stability three findings are worth special mention. So first, geopolitical events such as conflicts in international tensions can cause significant instability in financial markets. Now usually these events lead to greater uncertainty. And in so doing, this heightens market volatility, and then it leads to sharp drops and asset prices. It also causes investors to shift towards safer assets, such as sovereign bonds. So that means that geopolitical tensions really can affect everyone from the largest investment funds to pension funds to individual investors. Second, non-bank financial institutions such as investment funds, they're found to be particularly vulnerable to geopolitical risks. So when geopolitical tensions rise, they tend to experience rapid and substantial outlaws of capital. If they don't have sufficient cash balances on hand, that can lead to strains because it might force these funds if they don't have sufficient cash balances on hand, that can lead to strains because it might force these funds if they don't have the cash to sell assets so that they can give investors their money back. And so so-called for sales like this could cause even further downward pressure and asset prices, potentially creating destabilizing adverse feedback loops. And third, our work also shows that banks with weaker capitalisation and low profitability creating, destabilizing adverse feedback loops. And third, our work also shows that banks with weaker capitalisation and low profitability levels are disproportionately affected by geopolitical risks. Those banks tend to experience larger increases in their funding costs, reductions in their asset quality, and significant declines in their stock prices, illustrating really a pronounced sensitivity to geopolitical instability. So in a nutshell, geopolitical risk can pose a threat for financial stability. But we think it's unlikely that it could cause a systemic crisis, unless it exposed deeper vulnerabilities within the financial system. Now as to what we are looking out for right now, I should emphasize that we're not geopolitical experts, but we are monitoring developments in all of the potential geopolitical hotspots that you just mentioned. And what can banks and other financial institutions do in the face of this risk? But our main message here is that preparedness and diversification are crucial in preventing adverse geopolitical developments from triggering financial crisis. Financial institutions have a role to play in this and so do prudential policy authorities. Both must be proactive in monitoring geopolitical risks and in preparing for potential impacts. And there's actually a lot that financial institutions can do. They can diversify their investments. They can also ensure that they have strong liquidity positions for the reasons that I just mentioned, just in case depositors or investors need or want to access their savings in a hurry. Some financial institutions might even be able to purchase geopolitical risk insurance. Now other crucial preparation strategies include regular stress testing that can be carried out by the institutions themselves or they could be over exercises overseen by authorities and these can reveal any weaknesses in risk management and they can help with contingency planning. So identifying and addressing any of those weaknesses should ensure that geopolitical events don't threaten financial stability. Interesting. And this issue is really full of interesting topics now in your FSR. And one of them is AI, artificial intelligence. We've talked about AI a few times on the podcast, and dear listeners, you can find the links to those episodes in the show notes. But John, your colleagues looked at a different angle this time, the impact of AI on financial stability. Technology has seen huge leaps forward. Just think of the advances in generative AI like Chachipity for example. Now the use of these tools in the financial system is growing and this brings benefit but also risks. So John how can AI be used in the financial system? Can you give us some concrete examples? So even though it's a very challenging question to answer Stephanie, I'm glad you ask about the benefits. Our financial stability review is not a financial instability review, and that's for good reason. It does devote a lot of space to risks, and it does that with the intention of mitigating them and safeguarding financial stability. Technological breakthroughs have played an important role in supporting this objective in the past and we expect that they will continue doing so. The question is challenging though because we really only have about 18 months of experience with mass use of generative artificial intelligence and people are coming up with new use cases every day. What we're discovering is that the limit for this technology seems to be the limits of the human imagination. That raises the risk that listeners to this podcast ten years from now say might find our predictions naive and even amusing. Still, I think we can already take a stab at it. Drawing upon a wide range of information about how it's being used or how experts think it might be used, our special feature lists several potential benefits for revenue generation, for cost savings and for risk management. So if I just go through a few of those, starting with revenue generation, AI has the potential to improve product to customer matching. It can do that through more efficient analysis of diverse customer data. Targeting services better towards those who need them through for instance chat bots. Now if that's done well that has the potential to improve customer satisfaction and even customer retention. As for cost saving it can be deployed to automate routine tasks and entire work streams. It can also improve efficiencies in internal processes such as automated text preparation or even drafting computer code. An area where AI seems to be improving by the day. And then there's risk management. AI can manage data more effectively and it can enhance key functions such as fraud detection and capital planning. That can lead to more accurate assessments and better informed decisions. It can also support compliance with regulations by enhancing monitoring and reporting capabilities. And so that will reduce for buying some other financial institutions the risk of being confronted with non-compliance penalties. So clearly there are lots of good use cases but as I said before I also see risks. You mentioned a minute to go a chat board if done well could help a lot but my also misadvised a customer for example or a bank could make a decision based on an AI prediction and make a loss. Of course, human beings can make the same mistakes. But the difference is that AI can make them systemic, I would say. And that is all what financial stability is about, no? Looking at the financial system as a whole. John, can you expand on this for us? So a key question here is whether AI simply creates new ways for old sources of systemic risk to materialize or whether it introduces brand new sources of risk. So for example there's no doubt that it has the potential to create new and faster ways of spreading contagion. For example rumors that have adverse effects on markets. That's a given I think and not a new source of risk. What we've tried to do in the special feature is think through the consequences of some totally new sources of risk that AI might bring. And the conclusion that we reached is that if there is widespread adoption of AI tools within the financial system, and we really have no reason to believe that that won't be the case. Then if the number of AI suppliers is small and concentrated, operational risk may increase. Operation risk is a wide domain but it also includes cyber risk which could increase as well. Nowadays we often speak about the strengths that diversity brings. Well financial stability relies heavily on diversity. Nowadays we often speak about the strengths that diversity brings. Well financial stability relies heavily on diversity. Diversity of views, diversity of objectives, diversity of horizon even. So if AI reduces diversity, which for example many banks using similar AI models for trading, a fold or a bias in these models could lead to synchronized errors, amplifying market volatility and leading to significant financial instability. In addition, AI raises market concentration and too big to fail concerns. So on the risk of everybody using the same tools, what comes to my mind is like if there are several telephone networks, but most of us use the same telephone so basically almost all the people saying use the same telephone network and something goes wrong we are all cut off. Yeah so that's a good example and we've seen plenty of cases of winner-takes all firms in the information technology industry. There are household names you know them yeah and with economies of scale there is a view that we could also end up with a small number of artificial intelligence suppliers. Now if that happens, then many institutions might end up relying on a limited number of AI suppliers, as you said. And with that concentration, if one major provider was confronted with a technical failure, say, or a cyber attack, that could disrupt the services of many financial institutions simultaneously. So one could imagine a scenario where a leading AI provider system crashes. That could then hold trading activities affecting loan approvals, disrupting customer services across multiple banks and causing maybe even widespread panic and financial disruption. Yes. AI could also create a market environment where only the largest financial institutions who can afford to make investments in AI thrive. Now this is firms building their own AI. A concentration of power like that could lead to too big to fail scenarios where the failure of one large institution could pose a severe risk to the entire financial system. For example, if a major bank was relying heavily on AI for trading in the financial markets and it faced a critical system failure, that could trigger a market crash. And then I think this is one that a lot of people speak about the issue of what I would call distorted information processing. AI systems analyze and interpret vast amounts of data to make decisions. If many institutions use similar AI systems, that might lead them to reach the same conclusions and react similarly to market events, so resulting in in herd behavior. So for example, if the AI models were to predict a drop in stock prices and all institutions start selling their stock simultaneously, that could lead to a market crash. Even if the initial prediction of the model was wrong. Wow, and so this becomes an artificial intelligence group, basically, same risk. So where do we stand now, John, and how close are these risks? Right now I think it's fairly safe to say that these risks are not imminent and whether they become material or not very much depends on how widely and how rapidly AI is adopted. So I think there should be time for monitoring and making regulatory adjustments to address the risks that that current frameworks may not cover and I'm sure we will find things. First and foremost this will require close monitoring of levels of technological penetration and of the supplier concentration that I just spoke of. Okay. And so, if I understand correctly, AI risk is the one where maybe we need to keep the closest eye on. Am I right? Well, AI does raise some fairly fundamental issues about financial stability. The public good nature of it, so to speak. Arguably, there's hardly a day that goes by when one doesn't see a newspaper article dealing with the ethical and the trust issues raised by AI. Trust is at the very foundation of safeguarding financial stability and loss of trust can cause panic. These issues will need close scrutiny and further exploration to ensure the public confidence in the financial system remains strong if AI is widely adopted. Yeah, yeah. Thanks so much John. Before we wrap up we always have a question that we ask all our guests on the podcast and that's for a hot tip linked to the topic we discussed today so financial stability. I know you put a lot of thoughts into your hot tips John so what do you have our listeners today? So on this one I thought even more than usual and in the end I decided against offering a tip about existential implications of artificial intelligence we all know the movies there's no shortage of material available on this aspect of the internet and elsewhere. Instead I found an excellent TED talk by Sasha Luccioni. You tell me if I pronounce that. Sasha Lucconi. An AI ethics researcher. Now her talk entitled, her talk was entitled AI is dangerous but not for the reasons you think. And it covers a range of negative impacts of AI that are already apparent so we just talked about future risks she's looking at what risks are actually now materializing and it includes large carbon emissions of large language models infringement of copyright and the spreading of biased information. Wow and this brings us to the end of this episode. I want to thank you, John Fell, for updating us on financial stability outlook. Thank you, thank you so much. Thanks for having me.
