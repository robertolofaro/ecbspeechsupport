# ecbspeechsupport
A public repository to contain material supporting a webapp

The webapp, whose database is updated on a weekly basis, is available here: https://robertolofaro.com/ECBSpeech_index.php

Please refer there for further information about data sources, etc.


# Purpose

This repository has a main simple purpose: the material linked within the webapp includes also ECBPodcast- albeit so far only the outline available online as text.

The webapp allows a search either via a tag cloud or by selecting multiple keys (see at the link above).

As no transcript was available, using open source AI models and a custom pipeline of transformations to extract the transcript.

The aim is to support others who might interested (e.g. to see the evolution of communication), as can be done by accessing all the other written material available online on the original source.

Also, this should allow those with hearing issues to access also this part of the communication material posted online by the ECB.


# History

This repository has been initially loaded on 2024-03-19 with the automated transcripts of all the ECBPodcast episodes from 2019 until 2004-03-07.

As part of the weekly updates, future ECBPodcast episodes will be added here, and also the underlying database from 2004-03-25 will allow searching also the ECBPodcast content not just at the outline level, but also as any other text.


# Disclosure

I have no relationship whatsoever with the ECB..

Simply, I had previously 20 years of experience in banking across Europe mainly on the "number crunching" (management reporting, decision support, business intelligence), organizational development (systems&processes) and IT services/project management.

For my own publication purposes on https://robertolofaro.com decided to keep being informed, and in 2019 decided to share what I was anyway reading from public sources, in a way more accessible than page-by-page.
